# Item Effects Analysis Report

## Overview
This document lists all new item effects added in the recent commit, which items use them, and their implementation status.

---

## StatType Mapping
Based on `GameEnums.cs`:
- **StatType 20**: CritChance
- **StatType 21**: CritDamagePercent  
- **StatType 22**: ReflectDamagePercent
- **StatType 23**: HealthRegenPercent (no modifiers found yet)
- **StatType 24**: MagicDamageFlat
- **StatType 25**: PhysicalDamageFlat

---

## Base Stats Status ✅

**Item base stats are implemented correctly:**
- ✅ `hpBonus` - Applied to `maxHP`
- ✅ `attackBonus` - Applied to `attackPower`
- ✅ `defenseBonus` - Applied to `defense`
- ✅ `intBonus` - Applied to `intelligence`
- ✅ `manaBonus` - Applied to `mana`
- ✅ `agiBonus` - Applied to `agility`

All base stat bonuses work when equipping items.

## Implementation Status ✅

### ✅ **CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED**
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**What was fixed:**
- `Character.AddGearBonus()` now applies `gear.modifiers` (List<StatModifierSO>)
- `Character.RemoveGearBonus()` now removes modifiers before base stats
- Added `ApplyGearModifier()` and `RemoveGearModifier()` helper methods
- Tracks applied modifiers in `appliedGearModifiers` list for cleanup
- Integrated with `Equipment.ApplyGearStats()` which resets and re-applies all gear

**How to Test:**
1. Equip an item with modifiers (e.g., **Arcane Blade** - has MagicDamage + Lifesteal modifiers)
2. Check character stats - modifiers should be applied
3. Unequip the item - modifiers should be removed
4. Check console logs for `[GEAR]` messages confirming modifier application
5. Verify base stats still work (HP, Attack, etc.)

### ✅ **CritChance** (StatType 20) - IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 418
- Added handling in `PassiveSkillManager.ApplyMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 357
- Uses existing `criticalChance` field in Character.cs
- **Fixed:** Removed hardcoded 100% crit for player that was overwriting gear bonuses
- Properly integrated into `CheckCritical()` method

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Blade of Nightmares** (Legendary Weapon) - 50% crit chance
- **Heart of the Archmage** (Legendary Amulet) - 100% crit chance
- **Steel Saber** (Rare Weapon) - 15% crit chance
- **Silverclaw Dagger** (Uncommon Weapon) - 15% crit chance

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Blade of Nightmares** (50% crit) or **Heart of the Archmage** (100% crit)
2. Start combat and attack enemies multiple times
3. With 50% crit: Should see "CRIT!" messages approximately half the time
4. With 100% crit: Should see "CRIT!" on every attack
5. Check console for `[CRITICAL]` debug logs showing crit rolls
6. Verify crit damage multiplier is applied (should be higher than normal damage)
7. Unequip item - crit chance should return to 0%

---

### ✅ **CritDamagePercent** (StatType 21) - IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Replaced constant `CRITICAL_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER` with variable `critDamageMultiplier`
- Base value: `BASE_CRITICAL_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER = 1.5f` (150% damage)
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 423
- Added handling in `PassiveSkillManager.ApplyMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 361
- Initialized in `Awake()` and reset in `ResetToBaseStats()`
- Integrated into damage calculation in `Attack()` method - lines 263, 267

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Blade of Nightmares** (Legendary Weapon) - +100% crit damage (total: 2.5x damage)

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Blade of Nightmares** (has both CritChance 50% and CritDamage 100%)
2. Get a critical hit (should be frequent with 50% chance)
3. Check damage numbers - crits should deal 2.5x damage instead of base 1.5x
4. Base crit: 1.5x, With gear: 2.5x (1.5 + 1.0)
5. Unequip item - crit damage should return to 1.5x base

---

### ✅ **ReflectDamagePercent** (StatType 22) - IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `gearReflectDamagePercent` field separate from status effect reflect
- Combined with status effect reflect in `DamageReflectionPercent` property - line 972
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 427
- Added handling in `PassiveSkillManager.ApplyMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 366
- **Fixed:** Reflect calculation bug (was dividing by 100 when it shouldn't)
- **Fixed:** Reflect now works with or without shield (moved outside shield block)

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Aegis of Valor** (Legendary Chest Armor) - 10% reflect
- **Guardian Plate** (Epic Chest Armor) - 15% reflect

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Aegis of Valor** (10% reflect) or **Guardian Plate** (15% reflect)
2. Have an enemy attack you
3. Check console for `[REFLECT]` debug log showing reflected damage
4. Enemy should take reflected damage (10-15% of damage dealt)
5. Test both with and without shield - reflect should work in both cases
6. Unequip item - reflect should be removed

---

### ✅ **MagicDamageFlat** (StatType 24) - IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `magicDamageFlat` field in Character.cs
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearAdditiveModifier()` - line 330
- Added handling in `PassiveSkillManager.ApplyAdditiveModifier()` - line 296
- Integrated into `CalculateMagicDamage()` - line 620
- Applied before percentage bonuses (flat bonus first, then multiply)

**Gear Items Using This:**
- Currently no gear items use this modifier (exists but not assigned)

**How to Test:**
1. Create a test gear item with `MagicDamageFlat_10` modifier (+10 flat magic damage)
2. Equip the item and attack with magic damage (INT-scaling weapon)
3. Check damage numbers - should be 10 higher than without the item
4. Test with percentage bonuses - flat should add first, then percentages multiply
5. Unequip item - damage should return to normal

---

### ✅ **PhysicalDamageFlat** (StatType 25) - IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `physicalDamageFlat` field in Character.cs
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearAdditiveModifier()` - line 333
- Added handling in `PassiveSkillManager.ApplyAdditiveModifier()` - line 300
- Integrated into `CalculatePhysicalDamage()` - line 598
- Applied before percentage bonuses (flat bonus first, then multiply)

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Silver Ring** (Rare Ring) - Uses PhysicalDamage_5 (Note: This may be incorrectly configured - uses StatType 25 but value is 0.05 with Multiplicative type)

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Silver Ring** (if correctly configured) or create test item
2. Attack with physical damage (STR-scaling weapon)
3. Check damage numbers - should have flat bonus added
4. Test with percentage bonuses - flat should add first, then percentages multiply
5. Unequip item - damage should return to normal

---

### ✅ **LifestealPercent** (StatType 10) - WORKING
**Status:** ✅ **NOW WORKING** (Previously not applied, now fixed)

**Implementation Details:**
- Already implemented in `PassiveSkillManager` - now also works from gear
- Added handling in `Character.ApplyGearMultiplicativeModifier()` - line 407
- **LIFESTEAL CALCULATION FIX**: Now uses **actual damage dealt** (after DEF/shield reduction) instead of base damage
  - Attack lifesteal: Uses actual damage from `TakeDamage()`/`TakeDamageWithShield()` return values
  - Skill lifesteal: Already correctly uses actual damage from `ProcessDamageEffects()`
  - Conditional lifesteal: Also uses actual damage dealt
- **OVERHEAL → SHIELD MECHANIC**: When lifesteal would exceed max HP, 40% of excess healing converts to shield (2 turns duration)
- Shield cap: Maximum shield from overheal cannot exceed 100% of maxHP
- Implemented in `Character.RestoreHealth()` - automatically applies to all lifesteal sources
- **Shield Persistence Fix**: Shields are now cleared when battles end (in `BattleManager.VictoryRoutine()`)

**Overheal → Shield Details:**
- **Conversion Rate**: 40% of overheal amount → shield
- **Shield Duration**: 2 turns
- **Shield Cap**: Cannot exceed 100% of maxHP total shield (including existing shields)
- **Applies To**: All lifesteal sources (normal attacks, skills, conditional passives)
- **Example**: If you have 950/1000 HP and lifesteal heals 100 HP:
  - Heals to 1000 HP (+50 HP)
  - Overheal: 50 HP
  - Shield created: 50 × 40% = 20 shield (2 turns)

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Arcane Blade** (Epic Weapon) - 10% lifesteal
- **Blade of the Forgotten King** (Legendary Weapon) - 100% lifesteal

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Arcane Blade** (10% lifesteal) or **Blade of the Forgotten King** (100% lifesteal)
2. Attack enemies and deal damage (note the white damage number shown on screen)
3. **Verify Lifesteal Uses Actual Damage**:
   - Check console for `[ATTACK LIFESTEAL]` messages
   - Lifesteal should be calculated from the actual white damage number (after DEF/shield reduction)
   - Example: If you see "33" white damage, lifesteal should be 33 * 10% = 3 HP (not base damage)
4. Check HP after each attack - should heal for 10% (or 100%) of actual damage dealt
5. With 100% lifesteal: Should heal equal to actual damage dealt (be careful, can be OP!)
6. **Test Overheal → Shield**:
   - Get close to full HP (e.g., 950/1000 HP)
   - Deal damage that would overheal (e.g., deal 100 damage with lifesteal)
   - Check console for `[OVERHEAL]` messages showing shield conversion
   - Check shield UI/status - should show shield amount
   - Wait 2 turns - shield should expire
7. **Test Shield Clearing**: Complete a battle - shields should be cleared when battle ends
8. Unequip item - lifesteal should stop

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Soulbinder Amulet** (25% magic damage) or **Heart of the Archmage** (100% magic damage)
2. Use magic damage (INT-scaling weapon or magic skills)
3. Check damage numbers - should be 25% or 100% higher than base
4. Test stacking with multiple items - bonuses should add together
5. Unequip items - damage should return to normal

---

---

### ✅ **DodgeChance** (StatType 11) - WORKING
**Status:** ✅ **NOW WORKING** (Previously not applied, now fixed)

**Implementation Details:**
- Fixed dodge calculation to properly separate AGI-derived dodge from gear bonuses
- Added `dodgeBonusFromGearPassives` field to track bonuses separately
- Updated `UpdateDerivedStats()` to combine AGI dodge + gear bonuses

- **Windrunner Boots** (Epic Boots) - 6% dodge

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Boots of the Storm** (8% dodge)

3. Have enemies attack you multiple times
4. Should see "MISS" messages approximately 8% more often than without the boots
5. Unequip item - dodge should return to AGI-based only

---

### ✅ **DamageReduction** (StatType 12) - WORKING
**Status:** ✅ **NOW WORKING** (Previously not applied, now fixed)

**Gear Items Using This:**
- **Aegis of Valor** (Legendary Chest Armor) - 10% damage reduction
- **Guardian Plate** (Epic Chest Armor) - 12% damage reduction

**How to Test:**
1. Equip **Aegis of Valor** (10% damage reduction)
2. Have enemies attack you
3. Check damage received - should be 10% less than base damage
4. Test with different damage amounts to verify percentage calculation
5. Unequip item - damage reduction should be removed

---

### ⚠️ **PhysicalDamage_5 Modifier Issue** - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Status:** ⚠️ **POTENTIAL CONFIGURATION ISSUE**

**Issue:**
- **Silver Ring** uses `PhysicalDamage_5` modifier
- Modifier uses StatType 25 (PhysicalDamageFlat) but:
  - Value is 0.05 (suggests percentage)
  - ModifierType is Multiplicative (should be Additive for flat)
  - This is inconsistent - likely should be PhysicalDamagePercent (StatType 8) or configured differently

**Action Required:**
- Check if Silver Ring is supposed to give +5 flat physical damage or +5% physical damage
- If flat damage: Change to ModifierType.Additive and value to 5
- If percentage: Change StatType to PhysicalDamagePercent and value to 0.05 or 5

---

### ❌ **HealthRegenPercent** (StatType 23) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** ❌ **NO MODIFIERS FOUND YET**

**Reason:**
- StatType defined but no modifier assets exist
- No gear items use this effect yet
- Implementation would follow same pattern as other percentage effects

**When Implemented:**
- Add handling in both `Character.ApplyGearMultiplicativeModifier()` and `PassiveSkillManager`
- Add `healthRegenPercent` field to Character.cs
- Integrate into health regeneration system
