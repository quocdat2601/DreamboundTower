A familiar nightmare. You're in a library where books whirl around you like a storm, their pages screaming about tests, grades, and failure. The pressure is choking.

* ['I wonâ€™t fail!'] (Requires STR 15)
    { player_str >= 15:
        -> STR_Check_Success
    - else:
        -> STR_Check_Fail
    }

* ['I need a break.']
    ~ HealHP(30, "FLAT")
    ~ HealMana(30, "FLAT")
    You close your eyes and take a slow, deep breath, accepting the anxiety instead of fighting it. The vortex of books slows and settles. (+30 HP, +30 Mana)
    -> END

* [Hide in the corner.]
    You curl up, shielding your head, and wait for the suffocating nightmare to pass on its own.
    -> END
